# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub

This is my first time on GitHub. I've seen it advertised around and am finally diving in. I learned a bit of programming throughout studies as a mechanical engineer. I know computational coding applications that use C++, MATLAB, Mathematica, Excel VBA, and other various languages. I want to build on these skills but also branch out in to game/ application software design.
